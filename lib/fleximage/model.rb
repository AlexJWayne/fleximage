    # Provides class methods for Fleximage for use in model classes.  The only class method is
    # acts_as_fleximage which integrates Fleximage functionality into a model class.
    #
    # The following class level accessors also get inserted.
    #
    # * +image_directory+: (String, no default) Where the master images are stored, directory path relative to your
    #   app root.
    # * <tt>s3_bucket</tt>: Name of the bucket on Amazon S3 where your master images are stored.  To use this you must
    #   call <tt>establish_connection!</tt> on the aws/s3 gem form your app's initilization to authenticate with your
    #   S3 account.
    # * +use_creation_date_based_directories+: (Boolean, default +true+) If true, master images will be stored in
    #   directories based on creation date.  For example: <tt>"#{image_directory}/2007/11/24/123.png"</tt> for an
    #   image with an id of 123 and a creation date of November 24, 2007.  Turing this off would cause the path
    #   to be "#{image_directory}/123.png" instead.  This helps keep the OS from having directories that are too
    #   full.
    # * +image_storage_format+: (:png or :jpg, default :png) The format of your master images.  Using :png will give
    #   you the best quality, since the master images as stored as lossless version of the original upload.  :jpg
    #   will apply lossy compression, but the master image file sizes will be much smaller.  If storage space is a
    #   concern, us :jpg.
    # * +require_image+: (Boolean, default +true+) The model will raise a validation error if no image is uploaded
    #   with the record.  Setting to false allows record to be saved with no images.
    # * +missing_image_message+: (String, default "is required") Validation message to display when no image was uploaded for
    #   a record.
    # * +invalid_image_message+: (String default "was not a readable image") Validation message when an image is uploaded, but is not an
    #   image format that can be read by RMagick.
    # * +output_image_jpg_quality+: (Integer, default 85) When rendering JPGs, this represents the amount of
    #   compression.  Valid values are 0-100, where 0 is very small and very ugly, and 100 is near lossless but
    #   very large in filesize.
    # * +default_image_path+: (String, nil default) If no image is present for this record, the image at this path will be
    #   used instead.  Useful for a placeholder graphic for new content that may not have an image just yet.
    # * +default_image+: A hash which defines an empty starting image.  This hash look like: <tt>:size => '123x456',
    #   :color => :transparent</tt>, where <tt>:size</tt> defines the dimensions of the default image, and <tt>:color</tt>
    #   defines the fill.  <tt>:color</tt> can be a named color as a string ('red'), :transparent, or a Magick::Pixel object.
    # * +preprocess_image+: (Block, no default) Call this class method just like you would call +operate+ in a view.
    #   The image transoformation in the provided block will be run on every uploaded image before its saved as the
    #   master image.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     acts_as_fleximage do
    #       image_directory 'public/images/uploaded'
    #       use_creation_date_based_directories true
    #       image_storage_format      :png
    #       require_image             true
    #       missing_image_message     'is required'
    #       invalid_image_message     'was not a readable image'
    #       default_image_path        'public/images/no_photo_yet.png'
    #       default_image             nil
    #       output_image_jpg_quality  85
    #
    #       preprocess_image do |image|
    #         image.resize '1024x768'
