    # Resize this image, constraining proportions.  Options allow cropping, stretching, upsampling and
    # padding.
    #
    #   image.resize(size, options = {})
    #
    # +size+ is size of the output image after the resize operation.  Accepts either <tt>'123x456'</tt>
    # format or <tt>[123, 456]</tt> format.
    #
    # Use the following keys in the +options+ hash:
    #
    # * +crop+: pass true to this option to make the ouput image exactly
    #   the same dimensions as +size+.  The default behaviour will resize the image without
    #   cropping any part meaning the image will be no bigger than the +size+.  When <tt>:crop</tt>
    #   is true the final image is resized to fit as much as possible in the frame, and then crops it
    #   to make it exactly the dimensions declared by the +size+ argument.
    #
    # * +upsample+: By default the image will never display larger than its original dimensions,
    #   no matter how large the +size+ argument is.  Pass +true+ to use this option to allow
    #   upsampling, disabling the default behaviour.
    #
    # * +padding+: This option will pad the space around your image with a solid color to make it exactly the requested
    #   size.  Pass +true+, for the default of +white+, or give it a text or pixel color like <tt>"red"</tt> or
    #   <tt>color(255, 127, 0)</tt>.  This is like the opposite of the +crop+ option.  Instead of trimming the
    #   image to make it exactly the requested size, it will make sure the entire image is visible, but adds space
    #   around the edges to make it the right dimensions.
    #
    # * +stretch+: Set this option to true and the image will not preserve its aspect ratio.  The final image will
    #   stretch to fit the requested +size+.  The resulting image is exactly the size you ask for.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   @photo.operate do |image|
    #     image.resize '200x200', :crop => true
    #   end
